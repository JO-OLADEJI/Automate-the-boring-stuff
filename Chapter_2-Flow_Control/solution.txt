- False and True -> False
- False and False -> False 

- True or True -> True
- True or False -> True

- %

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

- = (assignment operator)

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
- a condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
- line 3
- line 5
- line 7

10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
- Ctrl + c

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
- break exits a loop instantly
- continue jumps back to the beginning of the loop (as a new iteration)

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
- range(10): starts from zero up to, but not including the argument
- range(0, 10): starts from the first argument up to, but not including the second argument
- range(0, 10, 1): starts from the first argument, step with the last argument, up to but not including the second argument

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
